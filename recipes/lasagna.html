        <p>This is a recipe for a special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made from scratch tomato sauce, with a nice cheesy filling. A more Traditional way to make lasagna would be made with ricotta however this will be a blend of <strong>small curd cottage cheese and Parmesan</strong>.
        I have not, as of yet, found a recipe that would even remotely top this (I mean it).</p><p><em><strong>Ideally to be served with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread or any of your favorite sides.</strong></p>
        <p>For this Piping hot dish recipe, we will need the following ingredients;</em></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
            <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>        
            <li>½ cup minced onion</li>           
            <li>1 can crushed tomatos</li>
            <li>1 can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 ½ tsp dried basil</li>
            <li>1 ½  tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 package lasagna pasta</li>
            <li>1 pound of cottage cheese</li>
            <li>3 Large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tsp ground black pepper</li>       

        </ul>
        <p>Right, now that you have your ingredients sorted, proceed to follow the steps below;</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat;
                cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent,
                about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar.
                Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>While the Pasta is cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>    
            <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. 
                Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese.
                Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
        </ol>
