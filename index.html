        <p>This is a recipe for a special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made from scratch tomato sauce, with a nice cheesy filling. A more Traditional way to make lasagna would be made with ricotta however this will be a blend of <strong>small curd cottage cheese and Parmesan</strong>.</p>
        <p>I have not, as of yet, found a recipe that would even remotely top this (I mean it). <em><strong>Ideally to be served with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread or any of your favorite sides.</strong></em></p>
